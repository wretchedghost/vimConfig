# vimConfig
This is my main vim config repo where I have tweaked my .vimrc file to work very efficiently for me. 

#### Plugins I use
    * goyo - Takes away the distraction bits found in vim and only presents you with your writings and which mode you are.
    * limelight - A handy plugin that darkens the non-current line you are one. Handy when all you want to focus on is the current line/paragraph.
    * lightline - A plugin that shows various details of the file you are currently editing. Also color is used to determine which mode you are in. It will showyour current mode, the filename, the type of file you are editing (markdown, bash, etc.), and line and column number, among others.
    * supertab - A plugin that can autocomplete program words.
    * vim-markdown - Enhances the interaction of markdown files. 
    * vim-sensible - Default plugin enhancements.
    * vim-vividchalk - My choice of text decoration.
