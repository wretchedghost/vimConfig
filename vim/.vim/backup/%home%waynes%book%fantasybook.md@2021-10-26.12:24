This is a tale an a magic and mystical creatures. A tale of good vs evil. A tale where evil is so intermixed in certain things that its hard to distingquish if it is evil at all. This tale involves griffins, an comet called comet of terror which causes animals to become possesed and reak havoc across the land. these terrors as they ar called are able to use their natural given strength to destroy and kill. They are also able to walk upright. They must be in the presence of the comet of terror for them to change. Which means cloud cover and mist magic may distrupt this terrible magic. 

characters: There are these theives who have found a peculiar statue that will make anyone turn to gold when they look upon the statue. -when they touch the statue with their bare skin or atleast turn parts of them into gold or stone. For some reason this statue also puffs up dirt from its mouth. ( idk why?) These theives found this statue in a large lake and where currently on the shore when these terrors began to attack. These thieves were lucky enough to survive due to plot points being in their favor. At the end of the story these theives successfully escape and still have the statue in their possession when one of the thieves (or call them rogues) looked upon the statue and was turned to gold. the other rogue said pity and now had one statue to turn things to gold and another that was already gold. 

This age is the golden age for elves and dwarves but will soon end and make it the golden age of man. New technologies are being built. Mountains are being mined and many precious metals are traded between the the elf and human nations. The Wood elves who remain the most numerous at this time will trade 

Humans: Humans number very few at this time. Currently dwarves and elves populate the majority of the land. 

Dwarves: Mountain/Sand/Sea
    * Perhaps I might label dwarves as red, gold, gray. Represents a certain thing about them. red dwarves are red skinned
    * Mountain Dwarves - Hardy humanoid creatures that spend most of their time underground. Often
        known as greedy and lusting for gold, mountain dwarves definelty like gold but these stories
        are exaggerated. These mountain dwelling creatures are known for their toughness due to
        working in the dark and hard tunnels and fighting goblins and other nasty underground
        creatures. 
    * Sand Dwarves - As the name implies, these dwarves make their dwellings in sandstone mountains found in desert biomes. The sand dwarf is one of the most elusive dwarves due to their choice of
        habitation, but also due to the difficulty of finding resources on the land sand dwarves mostly stay underground. Often many tribes are connected via deep tunnels. Sand dwarves are known to have very large and dark beards.
    * Sea Fairing Dwarves who live on an archepeligo. Are often called salt beards but mostly known as sea dwarves. These dwarves very fond of the sea and can often be found captaining their own ships for hire. These are most well travelled of the dwarves and most people get along with them.

Wizards or Elders as they are known are similar to human in form and alikeness but have no connection as they live for many more years than humans and even more years than elves. There are known to be only a few elders who are extremely eccentric but very wise and very rarely seen. They are known to use magiks but due to the stigma of darkmagiks they are not usually keen on displaying their powers to others. Very little else is known about them.

Elves: High Elves/Wood Elves/Dark

Goblins: small creatures that are quite crafty. They are often various shades of greens and yellows. Dark goblins exist but are very rare and those are the ones who usually have a natural tendancy to magiks. Goblins will often create tools and armors for themselves and others. most very mischevious and not to be trusted. It is also important to mention when you see one goblin, often there are many more to follow. 

Trolls: Large creatures that have tendancy to be imployed by the darkmagiks but sometimes other trolls couldn't be bothered. Often found demanding tolls to cross a bridge that they  confiscated and maintain, they will usually like to hear an adventurous story. You do not want to get on the bad side of a troll as they will smash even the largest of creatures that attempt to cross their bridge without paying. what they do the coins they recieve is anybody's guess. 

Golem: Animated rock creatures. These beasts were created from the winds when large magiks permeated large mountains and various rocks. It is believed they are remnant of the early days of when wickedmagiks were common upon the land. 


The main character was a powerful half elf king that through his birthrite and his deeds was given the ability to mount a griffin hawk, the most powerful and largest of all griffons. 
His weapon is two handed long sword.

One main character has power of conjuring a familiar. It is a wolf that looks like a wolf but its eyes are a glowing green-blue color. People will often mistake the conjured wolf for a real wolf/pet but others with more knowledge will know the wolf is souled magic entity. In this world familiars are highly contraversial as you must soul capture to do a conjuring. Now in this case this character soul conjured his dying friend to the wolf. Conjured familiars are unable to speak since the human mind cannot funtion in a unfamiliar body especially since the person who was soul captured was older. It is thought in some obsure, well hidden practices that if a person was soul conjured at a young age that they might have the ability to adapt better to the new body, but this practice would instantly bring the inquisition of blackarts streaming to that location. This character was able to have the soul capture done without causing the winds of magic to leave a trace due to the friend wanting to have this action done. blackarts is when the magic is done against the user's will. All magic will leave a trace once used and some places are stronger than others usually after large battles where powerful magiks were used and or where the winds blow. Some places on the continent are powerful in their source of magic and flow up like geisers.

## The blackarts inquisition
This is an organization funded by the church and the crown to stamp out any and all cases of blackarts used. blackarts are detected by very sensitive individuals under the implore of the inquisition then documented by scribes onto the book of miscomings(*?). These sensitive individuals are usually mute, dumb, and blind, but some are fully functional yet disturbed by the sense of magiks, individuals. Due to the money that the inquisition has they are provided with powerful weapons and often are found with a pegasus or a griffin or one of its variants. 

## Flying Mountable Creatures
Pegasuses and Griffin Variants number the most often used mounted creatures, though there are others. 

* Pegasus - Basically a horse with wings. Built for speed the pegasus is usually a long distance traveling creature. An alacore is faster in every regard although is virtually impossible to find and even harder to capture. 

* Griffin - An eagle/tiger hybrid creature. It is often believed that powerful magiks were used many milenia ago to create these obsure creatures. Obscure or not the griffin is very powerful and can easily take down a Pegasus if caught off guard. Griffins have several hybrids ranging from large cat sized creatures to the largest ones named griffin hawks. 

* Drakes/Dragons - Often called Draccons (druh-cones) are flighless young dragons. Nasty and strong creatures with sharp teeth, claws, and an affinity to burn things. Dragons number in few where most often will slumber for many decades at a time. 
    * Ice drakes
    * Fire drakes
    * acid drakes
    * undead drakes
