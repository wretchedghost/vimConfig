This is a tale an a magic and mystical creatures. A tale of good vs evil. A tale where evil is so intermixed in certain things that its hard to distingquish if it is evil at all. This tale involves griffins, an comet called comet of terror which causes animals to become possesed and reak havoc across the land. these terrors as they ar called are able to use their natural given strength to destroy and kill. They are also able to walk upright. They must be in the presence of the comet of terror for them to change. Which means cloud cover and mist magic may distrupt this terrible magic. 

characters: There are these theives who have found a peculiar statue that will make anyone turn to gold when they look upon the statue. -when they touch the statue with their bare skin or atleast turn parts of them into gold or stone. For some reason this statue also puffs up dirt from its mouth. ( idk why?) These theives found this statue in a large lake and where currently on the shore when these terrors began to attack. These thieves were lucky enough to survive due to plot points being in their favor. At the end of the story these theives successfully escape and still have the statue in their possession when one of the thieves (or call them rogues) looked upon the statue and was turned to gold. the other rogue said pity and now had one statue to turn things to gold and another that was already gold. 

This age is the golden age for elves and dwarves but will soon end and make it the golden age of man. New technologies are being built. Mountains are being mined and many precious metals are traded between the the elf and human nations. The Wood elves who remain the most numerous at this time will trade 

Humans: Humans number very few at this time. Currently dwarves and elves populate the majority of the land. 

Dwarves: Mountain/Sand/Island

Elves: High Elves/Wood Elves

Goblins:

The main character was a powerful elf knight that through his birthrite and his deeds was given the ability to mount a griffin hawk, the most powerful and largest of all griffons. 
His weapon is two handed long sword.

One main character has power of conjuring a familiar. It is a wolf that looks like a wolf but its eyes are a glowing green-blue color. People will often mistake the conjured wolf for a real wolf/pet but others with more knowledge will know the wolf is souled magic entity. In this world familiars are highly contraversial as you must soul capture to do a conjuring. Now in this case this character soul conjured his dying friend to the wolf. Conjured familiars are unable to speak since the human mind cannot funtion in a unfamiliar body especially since the person who was soul captured was older. It is thought in some obsure, well hidden practices that if a person was soul conjured at a young age that they might have the ability to adapt better to the new body, but this practice would instantly bring the inquisition of blackarts streaming to that location. This character was able to have the soul capture done without causing the winds of magic to leave a trace due to the friend wanting to have this action done. blackarts is when the magic is done against the user's will. All magic will leave a trace once used and some places are stronger than others usually after large battles where powerful magiks were used and or where the winds blow. Some places on the continent are powerful in their source of magic and flow up like geisers.

## The blackarts inquisition
This is an organization funded by the church and the crown to stamp out any and all cases of blackarts used. blackarts are detected by very sensitive individuals under the implore of the inquisition then documented by scribes onto the book of miscomings(*?). These sensitive individuals are usually mute, dumb, and blind, but some are fully functional yet disturbed by the sense of magiks, individuals. Due to the money that the inquisition has they are provided with powerful weapons and often are found with a pegasus or a griffin or one of its variants. 

## Flying Mountable Creatures
Pegasuses and Griffin Variants number the most often used mounted creatures, though there are others. 

Pegasus - Basically a horse with wings. Built for speed the pegasus is usually a long distance traveling creature. An alacore is faster in every regard although is virtually impossible to find and even harder to capture. 

Griffin - An eagle/tiger hybrid creature. It is often believed that powerful magiks were used many milenia ago to create these obsure creatures. Obscure or not the griffin is very powerful and can easily take down a Pegasus if caught off guard. Griffins have several hybrids ranging from large cat sized creatures to the largest ones named griffin hawks. 

Drakes/Dragons - Often called Draccons (dru-cones) are flighless young dragons. Nasty and strong creatures with sharp teeth, claws, and an affinity to burn things. Dragons number in few where most often will slumber for many decades at a time. 
    * Ice drakes
    * Fire drakes
    * acid drakes
    * undead drakes
