# Short Story - Naval Adventure

"Aye captain", said the dwarf as he struck the pose of salute as the captain walked passed. "Wake up the lot of you and onto the deck", shouted the captain.
The captain was a stern dwarf. He was not tall for a dwarf but he commanded his crew as if he was the size of a minator. His most noticable feature was his beard. It was a strange off-white color with a blue-green tinge to it. This feature was normal across those of his kind, well those of the salt beard clan. The common dwarf was about as tall as a 12 year old human child but as wide as barrel around the torso with strong arms and legs. The most prized asset of a dwarf were their large and usually extravgant beards. The beards of a dwarf are extremely thick and a strand is as strong as threaded rope. Most dwarves tended to stay far away from large bodies of water and live deep in the ground or upon the solid land of the terra but those of the salt beard clan loved the water. They loved the wind brustling at their whiskers and they loved the salty aroma of sea. Most land-dwelling dwarves often would remark that the color of the sea dwarves' beards were a curse placed upon Drunan, the dwarf god, for living near the waters and being in the sun for too long. What ever the reason, the captain was very comfortable with sea life. Infact, the captain was an excellent swimmer and fisherdwarf. In his youth, a few hundred years back, he was champion of the Archepeliego Swimming competition for several years before moving onto sailing the 12 seas. 

You could see the decades of thousands of naval voyages in his striking silver eyes and in his sun browned skin. He was known of smelling like citru and was very fond of eating oranges and limes, fruit skin and all. He would also pair up his ale with his favorite fruits called finger limes that he would harvest from his trees in his personal atrium on the ship. 
As the capitan walked passed the recreational chamber and climbed the stairs up to the deck he noticed sliver of wood splintering off the door frame. "That's odd", noted the dwarf. 
As soon as the capitan reached the deck he noticed all of crew where in line at attention. Some looked nervous. Some looked as though they were going to throw up. Others looked at ease. Those were the ones that had been in him employ for many voyages and were familiar with the captain's antics. 
"Here, here", shouted the captain as we paced in front of the crew taking one step, turning, then looking at the crew member in front of him. "You, how many years have you been on this ship?" "T-Two years sir", remarked the shaking crew member." "And in those two years how many crew members have we lost?" "I-I believe only one sir." "That is right! We have only lost one. And we lost him because we got sloppy. Had the", the captain turned and stepped towards the next crew member, "crew that were on duty not shared in the splendar of the party, Croker would not have tried hunting for mermaids and drowned. When you are on duty, no drinking is allowed."

The captain was leader of the most magnificent ship to sail the 12 oceans. It was a small sized vessel but was one of the smoothest and fastest rides anywhere. This was due to the ship being constructed entirely of elfwood. Elfwood was only found in one place in the land but only elves and only three dwarves in existance have laid eyes upon an elfwood forest. This was their most sacred location in which an elf that had died was returned to the earth to be reborn as an elftree. A sacred and special ritual was performed and only then would the body change into the essense of a tree. The Captain was one of the three dwarves. His help and love for elfkind allowed him to be given the gift of elfwood, the most holy of holies to an elf. With the elfwood he constructed a hilt for a waraxe made of hammernaught steel. He constructed a crossbow string with the sinew of the wood. Finally, he constructed the most elegant ship to sail the 12 seas. It was a ship that took on the essense of living creature. The ship would almost communicate with the sea and glide through it as if it wasn't there. Waves had almost no effect on the vessel. Every few years the ship would desire to return back to elfland and commune with its ancestors and family. It was often remarked by the crew that the captain had a connection with the ship. Not a connection like a great captain would have with his ship but more of a sense of love for the ship. He would speak to the ship in an imperceptable low voice and sometimes weep when doing so, although none of the crew would ever bring this up to him. The crew members also were amazed at how much the captain new of the going-ons in the ship. They always suspected the ship to not be a regular ship but this was only speculation on their part. 

The captain was part of a three-dwarf group that fought for and with the elfs during the time of darkelf decreeing genocide on the wood elves. The three dwarves consisted of Bromlin a Shield-Dwarf from the Golden Mountains in the North, Grunri the Bronze a talented two-handed axe weilder with his sandstone golem companion from the sand region Arid Mountains, and Arzil a ship captain from the Island Archipelego Salt Cap Mountains. Each one a warrior in their own right were blood-oathed to join a war in which the outcomes was very much in favor of the darkelves. It was during this time that Arzil fell in love with a beautiful wood elf named Elodulin or Elo for short. Elo who was essential to eah major battle succumed to her wounds and was given the elftree birthing ritual. Elo grew and grew over the years passed the war that an elf messenger, Landolin, contacted Arzil and told him that a gift neverbefore witnessed is upon him and that he is to be summoned to the woodelf domain. Arzil was not able to make it as soon as he would have liked but after another year fufilling his duties he made his journey. When he had arrived was adorned with many reefs and ornatments but the gifts given where oddly  given in a somber and sullen  manner. It was due to Elo communicating that she was to be cut down and constructed into a ship to sail the seas with Arzil until the end of his days.
