# Short Story - Naval Adventure

"Aye captain", said the dwarf as he struck the pose of salute as the captain walked passed. "Wake up the lot of you and onto the deck", shouted the captain. The captain was a stern dwarf. He was not tall for a dwarf but he commanded his crew as if he was the size of a minator. His most noticable feature was his beard. It was strange off-white color with a blue tinge to it. This feature was normal across those of his kind, well those of the salt beard clan. As you see most dwarves tended to stay far away from large bodies of water and live deep in the ground or upon the solid land of the terra but those of the salt beard clan loved the water. They loved the wind brustling at their whiskers and they loved the salty aroma of sea. Most land-dwelling dwarves often would remark that the beards of the sea dwarves was a curse placed upon Drunaan the dwarf god for living near the waters and being in the sun for too long. What ever the reason the captain was very comfortable with sea life. Infact the captain was an excellent swimmer and fisherdwarf. In his youth a few hundred years back, he was champion of the Archepeliego Swimming competition for several years before moving onto sailing the 12 seas. 
You could see the decades of thousands of naval voyages in his striking silver eyes and in his sun scorched skin. He would often smell of oranges and lemons as he was fond of eating the the fruit skin and all and would often drink his ale with one or two of his favorite fruits called finger limes. a sweet citrusy fruit resembeling a lime excepct for  from his personal stash.
