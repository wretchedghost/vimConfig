The comet of terror was known as the greatest calamity upon the face of the planet. The comet would near the planet once every 3000 years. Too long formhumans to remember or care about and just long enough for dwarves to hear stories about when they are children but long enough for elves to have the tales and horrors told to them from just three or four generations back. The comet as it neared glowed blood-red and could be seen both during the day and the night. As it neared things on the planet started to change.

This moon will cause tidal waves, earthquakes, and many other devastations as it nears the planet. magnetic tools that the salt beards use will become useless. Almost all magik that is not black magik will become unusable. It is up to the dwarves and their rune magik to help save the land. 

The moon caused magiks to intensify. It also caused many creatures to be born such as golems, griffins, unicorns, orcs, etc. Due to this it is often looked upon as a blessing that the moon came to exist at all and some few like minded sects perform riturals to summon this moon back. These do it in the misguided ideals that more wonderful creatures will emerge. It will come to a point that the leader of this sect is in fact a decendent of the first khaos lord who tricked many to perform forbidden arts. He goes about doing this by remarking the inquisition wouldn't want anyone to practice these darkarts since they want all the power to themselves.
