Dwarves as a whole are an industrious race who value money, using their powerful muscles and amazing crafting skills, growing and maintaining beards, and have an inhearent desire for honor. Men are the most commonly found sex of the dwarves which often outnumber women around 10 to 1. 
Dwarves are short and stout which they often use to their advantage. This will allow them to naturally sneak more easily than the larger folk, although dwarves are not known for their subtly nor their quiet-nature. Often found wearing heavy armor and weilding large weapons and tools they are usually only able to sneak passed those who are deaf. When a dwarf desires to sneak though, they can quite often hide well. 
Dwarves also are known to live for several hundred years. The oldest dwarf King Braxt Irondoor lived to be 701 years of age nearing the normal lifespan of elves. Due to this long lifespan dwarves have many years to perfect their craft be-it in whichever craft is their choosing. 

Dwarves are not know for their magic skills. Magic is looked upon as whimsicle and flaky and not at all in communion with hardy solid dwarves. Due to this dwarves are more tolerant to magiks then other races. They can handle simple frost and fireball spells without much issue whereas a human would be frozen or baked anr a elf would have their pointy ears and their silken clothing burn up. This is further based upon the extremes that the dwarves dwell in. Often cold drafty mountains ranges, deserts, islands with their tempests. 

## Mountain Dwarves
Mountain dwarves are the most common of dwarves. If there is a mountain range there is often dwarves who inhabit them. Often called: stone dwarves, shield dwarves, gold dwarves, or even less often gray dwarves, are known for their desire for treasures and especially gold. These industrious fellows will go to extreme lengths to get to the gold deposits by building machines and tools that other races could only deam of. The guild engineers are the only ones who have access to the full details of how these machines be-it war or industry are built. The downside to these guilds is that new technology innovations are often not allowed and are often outright banned unless the guild leaders agreed their is a flaw in the current design that needs to be improved. Getting a dwarf to admit to that kind of mistake is usually impossible. 

Mountain dwarves are slow to trust and almost never forgive. Past greivences are often recorded and passed down from father to son where it must often never go passed a fouth generation without it being rectified, by having the accused pay the cost of what the greivence is or by battle. Often, even death is not enough for the greivience to be forgiven and the eldest son will often inherent the greivence. This has led many a dwarf to become practicioners of dwarf law.

The beards of these dwarves often reach past their belt line and when performing war duties and needing to move quickly they will often tuck their beard into their waist. Due to the beard being important for a dwarf to show their age and class, beards will have many elaborate patterns and be adorned with precious metals and gems. 

### Weapons and fighting style
The primary weapons mountain dwarves use are axes and maces but have been found to use pickaxes and are quite efficient with the crossbow. Most moutain dwarves, when given the chance will also use a shield hence the name shield dwarves. 

## Hill Dwarves
Hill dwarves number among the mountain dwarves but a little shorter and a little darker. Mountain dwarves are often light skinned with various colors of hair from black, brown, red, and blonde. Hill dwarves can have the same color of hair and beard. Hill dwarves are often know as hairy dwarves as they tend to have very hairy bodies. These dwarves are often found living above ground and number in between many human civilizations.

## Desert Dwarves
Desert dwarves often refered to as red dwarves, sand beards (although this is deragatory). Desert dwarves are not often found above ground due to the arrid conditions in which they inhabit. The interneconnected tunnels between clans and sandstone mountain ranges are much more hospitable and is where these dwarves will often grow mushroom farms and other underground foods. Some desert oasises have been protected for so long that only the dwarves know about them. Occasionally an oasis will spawn allowing for dwarves to live both above and below ground but these oasises can usually be gone in a matter of a few years due to the every changing terrain. 

Desert dwarves often possess the largest of all beards. Their hair and beards are often black but some will often had flecks of red in their beards. 

Due to old magiks sandstone golems inhabit the land. Often known as protective of their space they will often chase outsiders away or even kill those that too close. The sand dwarves have successfully befriended these creatures and live symbiotilcally by protecting their land from outsiders.

There exists a legend of a sandstone golem that wonders the sands. Known to many as the largest and most least understood this golem is known to kill those it encounters. 

The Desert dwarves are known for their trade of quartz which is used in making cement as well as in magiks that magi and magus would use.

## Sea Dwarves
Sea dwarves are found very often at sea or harbors between the various races. These dwarves have become a common site among man and elf alike. Most often refered to as salt beards and less often as gully dwarves due to the person who made the remark either losing their memory due to a massive bludgeon to the head or by people being scared of saying that as not be bludgeoned upon themselves. 
These dwarves are often found as sea captains to the largest and most powerful of ships. Their spacial awareness and industrious nature has led them craft many a tool that many scholars and wizards praise for their simplicity yet ingenius nature. Tools such that follow the stars and moons by night and other tools that use strong magnetite stone for navigation.
