# Short Story - Naval Adventure

"Aye captain", said the dwarf as he struck the pose of salute as the captain walked passed. "Wake up the lot of you and onto the deck", shouted the captain.
The captain was a stern dwarf. He was not tall for a dwarf but he commanded his crew as if he was the size of a minator. His most noticable feature was his beard. It was a strange off-white color with a blue-green tinge to it. This feature was normal across those of his kind, well those of the salt beard clan. The common dwarf was about as tall as a 12 year old human child but as wide as barrel around the torso with strong arms and legs. The most prized asset of a dwarf were their large and usually extravgant beards. The beards of a dwarf are extremely thick and a strand is as strong as threaded rope. Most dwarves tended to stay far away from large bodies of water and live deep in the ground or upon the solid land of the terra but those of the salt beard clan loved the water. They loved the wind brustling at their whiskers and they loved the salty aroma of sea. Most land-dwelling dwarves often would remark that the color of the sea dwarves' beards were a curse placed upon Drunan, the dwarf god, for living near the waters and being in the sun for too long. What ever the reason, the captain was very comfortable with sea life. Infact, the captain was an excellent swimmer and fisherdwarf. In his youth, a few hundred years back, he was champion of the Archepeliego Swimming competition for several years before moving onto sailing the 12 seas. 

You could see the decades of thousands of naval voyages in his striking silver eyes and in his sun browned skin. He was known of smelling like citru and was very fond of eating oranges and limes, fruit skin and all. He would also pair up his ale with his favorite fruits called finger limes that he would harvest from his trees in his personal atrium on the ship.
