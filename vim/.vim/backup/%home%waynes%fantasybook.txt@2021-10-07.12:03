This is a tale an a magic and mystical creatures. A tale of good vs evil. A tale where evil is so intermixed in certain things that its hard to distingquish if it is evil at all. This tale involves griffins, an comet called comet of terror which causes animals to become possesed and reak havoc across the land. these terrors as they ar called are able to use their natural given strength to destroy and kill. They are also able to walk upright. They must be in the presence of the comet of terror for them to change. Which means cloud cover and mist magic may distrupt this terrible magic. 

characters: There are these theives who have found a peculiar statue that will make anyone turn to gold when they look upon the statue. -when they touch the statue with their bare skin or atleast turn parts of them into gold or stone. For some reason this statue also puffs up dirt from its mouth. ( idk why?) These theives found this statue in a large lake and where currently on the shore when these terrors began to attack. These thieves were lucky enough to survive due to plot points being in their favor. At the end of the story these theives successfully escape and still have the statue in their possession when one of the thieves (or call them rogues) looked upon the statue and was turned to gold. the other rogue said pity and now had one statue to turn things to gold and another that was already gold.
